# EV Simulation Project Analysis

## Overview
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) simulation project, focusing on the core simulation logic in `ev_simulation.py` and visualization components in `visualize_simulation.py`. The project simulates the behavior of EV commuters in an urban environment, including their charging patterns and infrastructure utilization.

## 1. Core Simulation (`ev_simulation.py`)

### 1.1 Key Components

#### 1.1.1 Location Class
- Represents geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Includes distance calculation using geodesic distance
- Optional node_id for road network integration

#### 1.1.2 ChargingStation Class
- Manages charging infrastructure with limited capacity
- Implements queue management for EVs
- Tracks occupied ports and charging agents
- Handles charging state transitions

#### 1.1.3 EVAgent Class
- Represents individual EV commuters
- Manages battery state (charge level, consumption rate)
- Handles movement and pathfinding
- Implements state machine for different agent states (at_home, commuting, charging, etc.)

#### 1.1.4 EVSimulation Class (Main Controller)
- Manages the overall simulation
- Handles time progression

## 2. Visualization (`visualize_simulation.py`)

### 2.1 Main Functions

#### 2.1.1 `visualize_network_and_stations()`
- Creates a static visualization of the simulation environment
- Shows road network, charging stations, and agent locations
- Displays charging station capacities
- Saves output as 'network_visualization.png'

#### 2.1.2 `run_and_visualize_simulation()`
- Runs the simulation and generates time-series visualizations
- Tracks and visualizes:
  - Agent distribution (home/office/commuting/charging)
  - Battery levels over time
  - Charging infrastructure utilization
  - Low battery agent counts
- Saves output as 'simulation_results.png'

### 2.2 Visualization Features
- Multiple coordinated subplots showing different aspects of the simulation
- Time-series analysis of key metrics
- Clear visual indicators for thresholds and critical states
- Professional styling with legends and grid lines

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Road network and charging stations are loaded from GeoJSON files
   - Agents are created with random home/office locations
   - Simulation clock is initialized

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   - For each time step:
     1. Agents update their state (move, charge, etc.)
     2. Charging stations process their queues
     3. Statistics are collected
     4. Time advances

3. **Visualization**:
   - Static visualization of the environment
   - Time-series plots of key metrics
   - Summary statistics

## 4. Key Metrics Tracked

- **Agent States**:
  - At home
  - At office
  - Commuting
  - Charging
  - Waiting to charge

- **Battery Metrics**:
  - Average battery level
  - Number of low-battery agents
  - Charging patterns

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Port utilization rates
  - Queue lengths at charging stations
  - Peak demand periods

## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### 5.1 Dependencies

   - Consider traffic conditions
   - Implement dynamic routing based on charging station availability

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Different types of EVs with varying characteristics
   - Charging pricing integration
   - Integrating highway conditions for intercity travelling
   - Weather and traffic condition simulation
   - Include more testing for the ev_simulator.py file in the debug_simulation.py file.

4. **Performance Optimization**: (Cannot be done for this BTP)
   - Parallel processing for agent updates
   - Spatial indexing for faster proximity searches
   - More efficient data structures for large-scale simulations

## 7. Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the visualization:
   ```bash
   python visualize_simulation.py
   ```

3. View the generated visualizations:
