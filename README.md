![Project Overview](./project.png)

## Overview

This project implements an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** to simulate Electric Vehicle (EV) commuter behavior and charging infrastructure utilization in the Kondapur-Hitech City-Gachibowli corridor of Hyderabad. The simulation models realistic commuting patterns, battery consumption, and charging station dynamics to analyze EV adoption scenarios and infrastructure requirements.

## Features

### üöó EV Agent Modeling
- **Realistic Vehicle Properties**: Battery capacity (30-60 kWh), energy consumption (0.12-0.18 kWh/km)
- **Individual Behavior**: Personalized charging thresholds, home/work locations, and commuting patterns
- **State Machine**: Comprehensive status tracking (at_home, commuting, at_work, seeking_charge, charging)

### ‚ö° Charging Infrastructure
- **Dynamic Charging Stations**: Variable capacity (2-6 ports per station)
- **Queue Management**: Realistic waiting systems when stations are full
- **22kW AC Charging**: Standard charging rates with time-based battery replenishment

### üìä Simulation Analytics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Step-by-step agent actions and station utilization
- **Performance Metrics**: Wait times, charging success rates, station efficiency
- **Utilization Reports**: Average and peak usage statistics for infrastructure planning

### üåç Geographic Modeling
- **Real Coordinates**: Kondapur-Hitech City-Gachibowli area (17.43-17.46¬∞N, 78.33-78.38¬∞E)
- **Haversine Distance**: Accurate distance calculations for energy consumption
- **Random Location Generation**: Realistic distribution of home/work locations
